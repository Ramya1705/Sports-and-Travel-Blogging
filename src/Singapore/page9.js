                <h1>Popular Tourist Destinations in Egypt</h1>
                <p>
                    Egypt is renowned for its ancient civilization and some of the world's most famous monuments, including the Pyramids of Giza, the Great Sphinx, and the temples of Luxor. The Giza Plateau, located just outside Cairo, is home to the three Great Pyramids, which have stood the test of time and remain one of the most awe-inspiring structures ever built by man. The largest of these, the Pyramid of Khufu, also known as the Great Pyramid, is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence.

                    The Great Sphinx, with the body of a lion and the head of a Pharaoh, stands guard over the Pyramids and is an iconic symbol of Ancient Egypt. Visitors can explore the Pyramids' interiors, though access may be limited to preserve these ancient structures. Nearby, the Solar Boat Museum houses a reconstructed boat believed to have been used in the Pharaoh's journey to the afterlife.

                    Beyond Giza, other significant sites include the Saqqara necropolis, home to the Step Pyramid of Djoser, which predates the Great Pyramid and represents an earlier phase in pyramid construction. The nearby ancient capital of Memphis offers a wealth of history, including statues and ruins that reflect its past glory.
