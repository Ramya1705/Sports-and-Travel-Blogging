                <p>
                    The Orchard Road district, which is dominated by multi-storey shopping centres and hotels, 
                    can be considered the centre of tourism in Singapore. Other popular tourist attractions include 
                    the Singapore Zoo, River Wonders, Bird Paradise and Night Safari. The Singapore Zoo has embraced 
                    the 'open zoo' concept whereby animals are kept in enclosures, separated from visitors by hidden 
                    dry or wet moats, instead of caging the animals. River Wonders features 10 different ecosystems 
                    around the world, including the River Nile, Yangtze River, Mississippi, Amazon as well as the Tundra 
                    and has 300 species of animals, including numerous endangered species. Bird Paradise is another 
                    zoological garden centred on birds, which is dedicated towards exposing the public to as many species 
                    and varieties of birds from around the world as possible, including a flock of one thousand flamingos. 
                    Night Safari allows people to explore Asian, African and American habitats at night without any visible 
                    barriers between guests and the wild animals.

                    The tourist island of Sentosa, which attracted 19 million visitors in 2011, is located in the south 
                    of Singapore, consists of about 20â€“30 landmarks, such as Fort Siloso, which was built as a fortress to 
                    defend against the Japanese during World War II. Guns from the World War II era can be seen at Fort Siloso, 
                    from a mini-sized to a 16-pound (7 kg) gun. Moreover, the island has built the Tiger Sky Tower, which allows 
                    visitors to view the whole of Sentosa, as well as the Sentosa Luge, a small one- or two-person sled on which 
                    one sleighs supine and feet-first. Steering is done by shifting the weight or pulling straps attached to the sled's runners.

                <h2>Tourist Events</h2>
                <p>
                    Singapore tourist events promote a variety of events all year round for tourists. Some of the anchor events are the Chingay Parade, 
                    Singapore Arts Festival and Singapore Garden Festival. The Singapore Food Festival is held every July to celebrate Singapore's cuisine.

                    Singapore hosted a round of the 2008 FIA Formula One World Championship (Singapore Grand Prix). The race, held on a new street circuit 
                    at Marina Bay, was the first night-time event in Formula One history. The event was considered an overall success due to the sheer amount 
                    of organisation, planning and hard work put into the event. Also in 2010, Singapore hosted the inaugural Youth Olympic Games, 
                    where the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said the Games are expected to generate a minimum of 180,000 visitor nights for Singapore.

                    Singapore has four zoos: the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, Bird Paradise, and River Wonders. The Singapore Zoo displays animals in 'open' naturalistic, 
                    spacious, landscaped enclosures separated from the visitors by hidden barriers, moats, and glass, with various shows and events occurring throughout the 
                    day to allow visitors to interact with the animals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Night Safari is the world's first nocturnal zoo, set in a humid tropical forest that is only open at night. It is divided into seven geographical zones, 
                    which can be explored either on foot via four walking trails or by tram. Bird Paradise is the largest bird park in Asia, with extensive specimens of exotic 
                    bird life from around the world, including a flock of one thousand flamingos. River Wonders features a tropical rainforest setting and 10 different ecosystems 
                    around the world, with 5000 animals of 300 species. Among the main attractions in the River Wonders is a pair of giant pandas, Kai Kai and Jia Jia, 
                    which are housed in a specially constructed climate-controlled enclosure that changes throughout the four seasons, emulating their original environment.
