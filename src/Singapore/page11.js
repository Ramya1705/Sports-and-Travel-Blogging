                    The Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, is the crown jewel of Agra's tourist attractions. 
                    Built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, the Taj Mahal is renowned for its stunning white marble architecture, 
                    intricate carvings, and beautiful gardens. The monument's perfect symmetry and the way it changes color with the light throughout the day make it 
                    a must-visit for tourists from around the world.

                    of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until the capital was shifted to Delhi. Within the fort, visitors can explore the Diwan-i-Am, Diwan-i-Khas,
