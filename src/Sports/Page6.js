          <h2>MOUNTAIN BIKING ACTIVITIES</h2>
          <p>
            Mountain biking is an adventurous and physically demanding sport that involves riding bicycles designed specifically for off-road terrain. It combines elements of cycling with the challenges of rugged trails and varied landscapes. Here are some key aspects of mountain biking:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>History:</strong> Mountain biking originated in the late 1970s when cyclists began adapting their bikes for off-road use. Early pioneers modified heavy-duty bicycles to handle rough terrain, leading to the development of purpose-built mountain bikes. The sport rapidly grew in popularity, and today it encompasses a wide range of disciplines and styles.

            <strong>Mountain Bikes:</strong> Mountain bikes are designed to handle the demands of off-road cycling. They typically feature a sturdy frame, wide knobby tires for traction, and suspension systems to absorb shocks from uneven surfaces. There are several types of mountain bikes, including hardtails (with front suspension only) and full-suspension bikes (with both front and rear suspension), each suited to different riding conditions and preferences.

            <strong>Types of Trails:</strong> Mountain biking trails vary widely in difficulty and style. Common types include cross-country trails, which are generally long and moderately challenging; downhill trails, which are steep and fast; and enduro trails, which combine both climbing and descending with technical sections. Riders often seek trails that match their skill level and desired level of challenge.

            <strong>Techniques:</strong> Mastering mountain biking involves developing skills for handling various terrain types and obstacles. Techniques include proper body positioning, braking, cornering, and navigating obstacles such as rocks, roots, and drops. Advanced riders often perform tricks and stunts, such as wheelies, bunny hops, and jumps, requiring precise control and balance.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Equipment and Gear:</strong> In addition to a mountain bike, riders typically use specialized gear to enhance their safety and performance. Essential equipment includes a helmet, gloves, and padded shorts. Other useful items include protective pads for knees and elbows, a hydration pack, and a repair kit for on-the-go fixes. Proper maintenance of the bike is also crucial for ensuring a safe and enjoyable ride.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Community and Events:</strong> The mountain biking community is vibrant and diverse, with enthusiasts of all levels coming together for group rides, races, and events. Local clubs, online forums, and social media groups provide opportunities to connect with other riders, share experiences, and participate in organized activities. Major events like mountain biking festivals and competitive races attract participants from around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Safety:</strong> Safety is a top priority in mountain biking. Riders should always wear appropriate protective gear and be aware of their surroundings. Understanding trail conditions, respecting other trail users, and riding within one's skill level are essential for reducing the risk of accidents. Additionally, carrying a first-aid kit and knowing basic bike repair techniques can be invaluable in case of emergencies.
          </p>
