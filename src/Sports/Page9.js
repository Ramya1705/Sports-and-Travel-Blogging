          <h2> SCUBA DIVING ACTIVITIES</h2>
          <p>
            Scuba diving offers an immersive experience into the underwater world, allowing divers to explore marine life and underwater landscapes. Here are some common scuba diving activities and equipment:

            <strong>Recreational Diving:</strong> This is the most common type of scuba diving, where divers explore coral reefs, wrecks, and underwater ecosystems for leisure. It typically involves diving to depths of 30 to 40 meters (100 to 130 feet).
            
            <strong>Technical Diving:</strong> Technical diving extends beyond recreational diving limits and involves the use of specialized equipment and techniques. This includes deep diving, cave diving, and wreck penetration dives.
            
            <strong>Free Diving:</strong> Free diving, or breath-hold diving, is performed without the use of scuba tanks. Divers rely on holding their breath to explore underwater. It includes disciplines such as static apnea, dynamic apnea, and constant weight diving.
            
            <strong>Underwater Photography:</strong> Many divers engage in underwater photography to capture the beauty of marine life and underwater landscapes. Specialized cameras and housings are used to take high-quality photos and videos underwater.
            
            <strong>Marine Conservation:</strong> Scuba divers often participate in conservation efforts to protect and preserve marine environments. Activities may include underwater cleanups, coral reef monitoring, and educating others about marine conservation.
            
            <strong>Technical Equipment:</strong> 
            Scuba diving requires specialized equipment such as masks, fins, snorkels, wetsuits or drysuits, buoyancy control devices (BCD), regulators, and tanks. Each piece of equipment plays a crucial role in ensuring safety and comfort underwater.

            <strong>Diving Certification:</strong> To ensure safety and competence, divers are required to obtain certifications from recognized agencies such as PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructors), NAUI (National Association of Underwater Instructors), or SSI (Scuba Schools International). Certifications range from beginner levels to advanced and instructor levels.
