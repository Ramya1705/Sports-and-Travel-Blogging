          <h2>TREKKING ADVENTURES</h2>
          <p>
            Trekking is a popular outdoor activity that involves long walks or hikes, often in mountainous or rugged terrain. It's a way to explore nature, challenge oneself physically, and enjoy breathtaking landscapes. Here are some key types of trekking activities:

            <strong>Day Treks:</strong> Short hikes that can be completed in a single day. These treks are ideal for beginners and those looking for a quick outdoor escape. Popular day treks can be found in national parks and nature reserves.

            <strong>Multi-Day Treks:</strong> These treks span several days and require camping or staying in huts along the route. They offer a more immersive experience and often traverse varied landscapes. Examples include the Inca Trail in Peru and the Laugavegur Trail in Iceland.

            <strong>High Altitude Treks:</strong> These treks take place at higher elevations and require acclimatization to avoid altitude sickness. They are typically more challenging and require careful planning. Examples include trekking in the Himalayas or the Andes.

            <strong>Expedition Treks:</strong> These are extended treks that can last several weeks or even months. They often involve reaching remote or extreme locations and require a high level of fitness and preparation. Famous expeditions include treks to Everest Base Camp or the Amazon Rainforest.

            <strong>Technical Treks:</strong> These involve specialized skills and equipment for navigating challenging terrain, such as rock climbing or glacier travel. Technical treks often require prior experience and sometimes professional guidance.

            Trekking can be both a solitary and social activity, with options ranging from solo hikes to guided group treks. It provides an opportunity to connect with nature, achieve personal goals, and create lasting memories.
