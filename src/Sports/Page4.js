          <h2>HANDGLIDING ACTIVITIES</h2>
          <p>
            Handgliding, or more commonly known as hang gliding, is a recreational
            and competitive air sport where pilots fly lightweight, non-motorized
            glider aircraft. The experience of hang gliding involves soaring through
            the air and navigating with the wind. Key aspects and activities of hang
            gliding include:

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Basic Hang Gliding:</strong> Involves flying a lightweight
              glider, usually made of a metal frame covered with a fabric wing. Pilots
              launch from hills or tow launches and rely on thermals and wind currents
              for lift and navigation.</li>
              <li><strong>Cross-Country Flying:</strong> A more advanced form of hang
              gliding where pilots travel long distances, often crossing significant
              terrain. This requires knowledge of weather patterns, navigation, and
              advanced gliding techniques.</li>
              <li><strong>Acro Hang Gliding:</strong> A competitive and artistic form
              of hang gliding that involves performing aerobatic maneuvers such as spins,
              loops, and wingovers. This requires advanced skill and control of the glider.</li>
              <li><strong>Mountain Launches:</strong> Launching from mountainous
              terrain to take advantage of strong winds and updrafts. This requires
              specialized equipment and skills for safe and effective launches and landings.</li>
              <li><strong>Safety and Training:</strong> Proper training and safety
              measures are crucial in hang gliding. Pilots are advised to undergo
              professional instruction and always fly with appropriate safety gear.</li>
            </ul>

            Hang gliding offers a unique perspective on flying and the thrill of soaring
            through the air with minimal equipment. It's a sport that combines the
            beauty of flight with the challenge of mastering aerodynamic principles.
