          <h2>CAVING ACTIVITIES</h2>
          <p>
            Caving, also known as spelunking or potholing, involves exploring
            caves and underground passages. Caving can range from casual exploration
            of accessible caves to challenging expeditions in deep, intricate cave systems.
            Major categories and activities within caving include:

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Casual Caving:</strong> This involves exploring relatively
              accessible caves with minimal equipment. Itâ€™s often done for recreational purposes
              and may include walking tours of show caves with well-established paths.</li>
              <li><strong>Technical Caving:</strong> This type involves advanced techniques,
              including rappelling, climbing, and using specialized gear to navigate difficult
              passages. It often requires knowledge of cave formations, safety procedures, and
              navigation skills.</li>
              <li><strong>Cave Diving:</strong> Combining scuba diving with caving, cave diving
              requires specialized training and equipment to explore underwater cave systems.</li>

              <li><strong>Exploration and Mapping:</strong> Many cavers participate in the
              exploration and mapping of new or uncharted cave systems, contributing valuable
              information to the caving community.</li>
              <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Caving also involves efforts to protect and
              preserve cave environments, including respecting wildlife, minimizing impact, and
              supporting conservation organizations.</li>
            </ul>

            Caving can be a thrilling and educational experience, offering a unique
            perspective on natural underground environments and geological formations.
