          <h2> SKIING ACTIVITIES</h2>
          <p>
            Skiing is a popular winter sport that involves gliding over snow using skis. It can be enjoyed recreationally or competitively. Here are some common skiing activities and types:

            <strong>Alpine Skiing:</strong> Also known as downhill skiing, this involves skiing down snow-covered slopes with fixed-heel bindings. It's often done at ski resorts with chairlifts and groomed trails. Alpine skiing includes various disciplines like slalom, giant slalom, super-G, and downhill racing.

            <strong>Cross-Country Skiing:</strong> Also known as Nordic skiing, this involves skiing across flat or gently rolling terrain. It uses lightweight skis and requires a different technique from alpine skiing. Cross-country skiing can be enjoyed on groomed tracks or off-trail in backcountry areas.

            <strong>Freestyle Skiing:</strong> This includes disciplines like mogul skiing, aerials, and skiing in terrain parks. Freestyle skiing emphasizes tricks, jumps, and creative maneuvers. It is popular in both competitive and recreational skiing.

            <strong>Backcountry Skiing:</strong> Also known as off-piste skiing, this involves skiing in natural, ungroomed terrain away from ski resorts. It often requires additional equipment like avalanche transceivers, shovels, and probes for safety.

            <strong>Telemark Skiing:</strong> This is a technique where the skier's heel is free, allowing for a distinctive "telemark" turn. Telemark skiing can be done on alpine or backcountry terrain and is known for its smooth, flowing turns.

            <strong>Adaptive Skiing:</strong> This includes specialized equipment and techniques to accommodate individuals with physical disabilities. Adaptive skiing programs often use sit-skis, mono-skis, or other modifications to enable skiing for all abilities.

            <strong>Skiing Equipment:</strong>
            Skiing requires various equipment, including skis, bindings, poles, ski boots, and appropriate clothing. Helmets, goggles, and gloves are essential for safety and comfort. Additionally, ski maintenance tools and wax can improve performance.

            <strong>Skiing Resorts and Trails:</strong> Ski resorts offer a variety of trails catering to different skill levels, from beginner slopes to advanced runs. Resorts often provide amenities such as rental equipment, ski schools, and apr√®s-ski activities.

            <strong>Skiing Safety:</strong> It's important to follow safety guidelines, such as wearing appropriate gear, understanding trail ratings, and being aware of weather conditions. Skiers should also be knowledgeable about avalanche safety if skiing in backcountry areas.
